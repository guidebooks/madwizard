Conda is an open-source package management system and environment
management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Conda
quickly installs, runs, and updates packages and their
dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between
environments on your local computer. It was created for Python
programs but it can package and distribute software for any language.
